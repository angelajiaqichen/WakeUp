The collections that we are using on firebase will be the containers for our documents. In our demo, we work with the Users struct, and we have a collection of users. For each user, we have 1) their UUID, which is a unique identifier for their iOS device 2) their streak, which is the number of consecutive days that they have used the app 3) their notification settings, which is whether they would like to revceive notifications, and 4) their list of selected features.
