The collections that we are using on firebase will be the containers for our documents. In our demo, we work with the Users struct, and we have a collection of users. For each user, we have 1) their id, which is a unique identifier each entry from the user end 2) device ID which is unique for each device 3) date of the entry 4) a list of intentions written by the user 5) their list of selected features 6) stored quote 7) suggestions 8) affirmations
For the get and updateIntentionData functions, we could see the entry from the firebase
